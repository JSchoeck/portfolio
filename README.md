### Work Data Projects
#### SPEA
A tool to deal with data from an end of line tester in a production environment for electronics (PCBA production). Imports large amount of original csv data files, stiches them together, selects relevant features, handles missing and incomplete data and tests, adds features and creates different plots with insights into tests results. 

#### EOL_BMG
Analysis and classification of serial production end of line tester data using different models. Dataset is large with many features and prediction was for the class of error, using several possible error codes. Results were quantified using a confusion matrix, summing up correct predictions and dividing by the total to get the percentage of correct predictions.
The results yield insight into reasons of failure and help increase the yield of the production line.

### Kaggle Competitions
#### Tweet Sentiment Extraction
Text analysis challenge to find the parts of a tweet that have been associated with positive, neutral or negative sentiments. Used bag of word method to feed into kNN classification algorithm. Also played with the data to predict which sentiment would be assigned based on word count of the tweet or of the selected part of it and compared it to a random selection model.

#### Titanic
Classic data analysis / machine learning entry classification data set to predict survivors of the Titanic accident. Analyzed the data, performed feature selection and engineering. Applied different classification algorithms and compared their performance.
